# Digit recogniser

This repo demonstrates the use of a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a model on the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset of handwritten single digits.

We further make the model available via a Streamlit frontend, allowing the user to sketch a digit themselves and see if the model can identify it correctly. They can then submit their effort (along with a label) to a database in the backend, with an eye to refining the model later on.
